Reasons for using Microservices

* Services are independently deployable. In a monolith application, a change to any component requires a full redeploy of the entire application. In a Microservices application only affected services must be redeployed (most of the times).
* More explicit component interface. HTTP interfaces define unbreakable boundaries between services. In a monolith application with shared codebase it is difficult to forbid over-tight coupling between components.
